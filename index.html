                <h3><strong>Greetings! Saeed here.</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    I've always felt good with numbers. Having majored in Electrical Engineering at CSULA, and realizing it isn't the route for me, I started
                    exploring options for myself. I moved to Ohio, and transferred to the University of Akron. Realizing I had a long road ahead of me trying
                    to get a bachelor's in Computer Science, I wanted to explore options that would make the conversion to software engineering less tedious 
                    for me. I did a bit of researching and lo and behold, I'm a Coding-Temple student.

                <h1>Why software engineering?</h1>
                <p> 
                    I love challenges. The sweat going down my forehead, stressing, trying to figure out a problem. While working with electrical engineering,
                    I found that the challenges I was dealing with didn't let me explore my creative side. I stumbled upon codes plenty of times in my life, and
                    it always begged the question: "What is all of this?!"

                </p>
                <p>
                    Pondering with all of this, I figured I'd look into it with more detail. To be honest, it started off too basic for me to really be convinced
                    that coding is the tell-all to an app. However I started learning more and more, and the pieces were pulling itself together. Everything was
                    seemingly connected and making sense to me. I love the creativity you can have with software engineering, down from the way a web page can look
                    like, all the way to how the app functions. Everything is accounted for and the precision on codes, makes me excited more than anything.

                <h1>What led to Coding Temple?</h1>
                <h3><strong> The ideal option</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Obviously, coding camps can be fairly pricey and we wanted to get the best bang for our buck. Well with Coding Temple, they had us take this test
                    prior to enrolling that tested our knowledge on computers/code in general. They were generous with their room for error. I felt that teaching myself
                    had always been my forte for learning. With the lectures I've seen so far, I don't feel like I'm in school and there's a bunch of other students dreading
                    being there. It feels like Brandon is a very educated friend and is teaching me how to code in a way that I can understand.

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                    I enjoy playing basketball and watching Netlfix. Pretty much anything on Netflix, I probably have watched. I used to watch the NBA a lot and dabble a bit into
                    the NFL, however due to time constraints, I hadn't been able to watch much because of time constraints. If you ever get to reading this, feel free to add me on PSN:
